    <h2>🤔 What is this?</h2>
    <p>The UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) is cycling's world governing body. They organize all the major mountain bike competitions - World Cups, World Championships, and continental events. Normally you'd have to manually check their website to see when races are happening.</p>
    
    <p>This service automatically watches the UCI calendar and converts it into a format your calendar app can understand. Once you subscribe, you'll get automatic updates whenever new races are announced or schedules change.</p>
